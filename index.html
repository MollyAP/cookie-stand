                    <h2>Founding of the Company</h2>
                    <p>
                        Pat's Salmon Cookies was founded by Pat, a passionate environmentalist and a lover of sweets.
                        Pat
                        always had a keen interest in sustainable practices and wanted to make a positive difference in
                        the
                        world. One day, while enjoying a cup of coffee, Pat came up with the idea of creating a sweet
                        treat
                        that not only satisfied people's sweet tooth but also promoted the health and sustainability of
                        our
                        environment. Despite having limited knowledge about running a business or even creating a
                        website,
                        Pat was determined to turn the idea into a successful business and set out to make his vision a
                        reality. He reached out to friends and family for help, and with their support and guidance, Pat
                        eventually found great success.

            <h2>Helping the Salmon</h2>
            <p>
                At Pat's Salmon Cookies , we strongly believe in the importance of preserving and protecting the salmon
                population in our area. We have formed a partnership with a local salmon conservation group to support
                their
                efforts to improve salmon habitats, ensure sustainable fishing practices, and educate the public about
                the
                importance of salmon conservation. A portion of our profits goes directly to this important cause, and
                we are
                committed to doing our part in ensuring that salmon populations thrive for future generations. As a
                company that
                cares deeply about the environment, we understand that salmon is not only an important source of food
                for humans
                but also the critical role that they play in maintaining the health of our oceans and freshwater
                habitats.

            <h2>All Natural ingredients</h2>
            <p>
                We don't believe in using artificial sweeteners or sugar in our cookies, which is why we use Stevia, a
                natural sweetener that is much healthier for you. Stevia is a zero-calorie sweetener that has been used
                for centuries and has a much lower glycemic index than sugar, making it a perfect substitute for people
                who are trying to manage their blood sugar levels or trying to reduce their sugar intake. Our cookies
                are also packed with other healthy substitutes such as whole grains, nuts, and seeds, which are rich in
                fiber, protein, and healthy fats. These ingredients make our cookies not only a delicious treat but also
                a healthy snack that can keep you energized and satisfied throughout the day. Thanks to your buddy Pat,
                you can indulge in a delicious, treat that satisfies your sweet tooth and supports a healthy lifestyle too.

                <p>"I have tasted many things in my afterlife, and yet these cookies somehow manage to bring me a
                    bittersweet sense of nostalgia. The chocolate taste is a reminder of what I once had and will never
                    have again. But for a fleeting moment, I am comforted by their sweetness. Perhaps that is enough for
                    now." </p>
